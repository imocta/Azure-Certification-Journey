The information and data stored in the cloud, the devices allowed to connect to the contracted cloud service and accounts and identities of people, services and devices within the organization, are all always responsibilities of the consumer.

The Physical datacenter, physical network and physical hosts are all always responsibilities of the Cloud Provider.

The chosen service model will determine responsibility for services like:

- Operating Systems
- Network Controls
- Applications
- Identity and Infrastructure
