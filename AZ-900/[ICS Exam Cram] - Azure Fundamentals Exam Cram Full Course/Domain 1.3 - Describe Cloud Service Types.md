# Describe Cloud Service Types

Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Describe Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Describe Software as a Service (SaaS)
Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service

*Walkthrough of 'Shared Responsibility Model'*

  

From the types of cloud, there are Iaas, Paas and SaaS. There is the model of shared responsibility. This model explains which responsibility each Cloud Service Type handles. There is an image of the model, but first I'll write which responsibility for each model, aiming to added learning possibility through repetition. 



**CSP (CloudServiceProvider) Responsibility:**

**On-Premises**: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage and Networking.

**IaaS**: Virtualization, Servers, Storage and Networking.

**PaaS:**  Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage and Networking

**SaaS: ** Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, networking, ***and the shared responsibility of*** Applications and Data.

**Hybrid Cloud:** The Hybrid model include the IaaS responsibility package at minimum, with capabilities to scale to more responsibilities depending on the customer's choices.



* ***Important distinction**: Cloud Deployment and Cloud Services. Cloud deployment would be the Location and Ownership of each model provides. Hybrid, Private and Public, would be Deployment Models, where as Iaas, Saas and Paas are the Service Model, managing the tech stack.*



### Cloud Models and Services

#### **IaaS** - 

- ***CSP provides*** the building blocks. Building blocks are *Networking, Storage, Servers and Virtualization.*
- ***CSP manages*** staff, HW, and datacenter

All major CSPs have an IaaS offering.
