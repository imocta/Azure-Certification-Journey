# Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud

Two crucial cloud benefits that helps develop solutions with confidence are **Reliability** and **Predictability**.



#### Reliability

This is an ability to recover from failures and not stop functioning. It's one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework... which are set of quality-driven tenets (principles), architectural decision points, and review tools intended to help solution architects.

Cloud supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure by virtue of its decentralized design. The design enables resource deployment in regions around the world. In case of catastrophic events, regions not affected will still be up and running.

It's possible to design applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability, to automatically shift the cloud environment itself to a different region.

#### Predictability

Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. Both performance and cost predictability are influenced by Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. Deploy a solution built around this framework and you'll have a solution whose cost and performance are predictable.

#### Performance

Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive to the customer.
Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability, those are some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.

If more resource is needed, autoscaling can deploy it to meet demand, and scale back when demand drops. 
If traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing redirects some of the overload to less stressed areas.

#### Cost

Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.
It's possible to track resources in real time in the Cloud, monitor resources, apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments.
Operating in cloud and using cloud analytics and information, it's possible to predict future costs and adjust the resources as needed.
It's even possible to use tools like Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.
