# Describe the consumption-based model

In IT Infrastructure model, exists two types of expenses. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx).

**CapEx** - One-time (typically), up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
Ex.: New building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, buying a company vehicle.

**OpEx** - Expenditure on services or products over time. 
Ex.: *Renting* a convention center, *leasing* a company vehicle, signing up for cloud services.

Cloud computing is an Operation Expenditure (OpEx) because it's a consumption based model. Continuously consuming the service.

You don't pay for physical infrastructure, electricity, security or other factors related to maintaining a datacenter. You pay for the resources you use only.

**Benefits of consumption based model** - 

- Takes away upfront costs
- Takes away need to purchase and manage infrastructure that might not reach full potential
- Gives the ability to pay for more resources as it's required
- Gives the ability to stop paying for resources that are not longer needed

Adopting a CSP will also allow the company to not have to handle an Datacenter creation/management, changing the whole approach to a business. You no longer have to handle issues relating upscaling and supporting a whole datacenter, nor the same pattern of costs.

There is also no issues with not reaching 100% of resource requirements, because it's possible to add more on the go, and drop if no longer needed, paying only for what is being used currently.

### Compare cloud pricing models

Cloud computing is a delivery of computing services over the internet, by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Typically the customer pays only for the cloud service he'll use. This helps in:

- Planning and managing operation costs
- More efficient infrastructure run
- Scalability

In other words: Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter. Cloud resources can be treated like they would be in the customer's own datacenter, but you give them back when you finish using, and are billed only for what you used.

The cloud takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure, enabling the customer to quickly solve their toughest business challenges and bring modern solutions to their users.
